# Hey

Human-oriented UI for git.


## What is meant by "Human-oriented UI for git"?

Git is easy, right? No, actually, [git is](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25121416) [hard](https://ohshitgit.com/). This application should make git more intuitive to use.


## Why the funny name?

If we transpose the keypresses of `git` on a QWERTY keyboard from the right hand to the left and vice versa, we get `hey`. Also, `hey` is an informal greeting in many languages, and this application is intended to be an informal interface to `git`.
